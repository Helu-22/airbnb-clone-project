## UI Component Patterns

To ensure a modular and reusable structure, we will design the following UI components for the AirBnB clone:

### 1. Navbar
- Contains logo, search input, user navigation
- Adapts to mobile with a responsive menu

### 2. Property Card
- Displays a property’s image, price, location, and rating
- Includes a “favorite” (heart) button
- Fully responsive and used across listing pages

### 3. Footer
- Contains links to pages (About, Contact, FAQs)
- Social media icons and copyright
- Styled consistently with overall theme

These components will be built with reusability and responsiveness in mind to maintain a consistent user interface across the app.
